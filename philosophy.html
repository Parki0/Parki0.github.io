    <h1>Explain one thing at a time.</h1>
    <p>
    	One tutorial should cover one and only one thing.<br>
    	This is very important because if tutorial explains several things at a time
    	that would be a waste of time of one who reads the tutorial.
    </p>

    <h1>People with different learning skill have to read the same article.</h1>
    <p>
      Some people can get things on the fly, some people need in depth explanations.<br>
      If you write a short version of tutorial for the first group,
      the second group won't understand that. And vise versa.<br>
      I think that this method could solve this problem.

    <h1>Feedback.</h1>
    <p>
      Tutorials are mass product so
      if you write a good tutorial with some bottleneck which is hard to understand
      you will waste peoples time.
      So you need to ask for a feedback.
      And don't you tell me that there is a comment section where everyone can say that something is wrong.
      Because we don't tend to attempt to do thing we think will fail.
      To write a critic is a work, no one going to do that if they would know that you won't listen to them.

    <h1>Traceback</h1>
    <p>
      To understand some stuff you need to understand another.
      For example you probably won't be able to understand a tutorial about functor as you first programming lesson ever.
      That was an exasdfa example.

      But every tutorial have to refer to what you need to understand to take this one.
